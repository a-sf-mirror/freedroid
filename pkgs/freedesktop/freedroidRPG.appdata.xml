    <p>
     FreedroidRPG is an original isometric 3D role playing game 
     taking place in the future, on Earth. It features action and 
     dialogs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The game tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between
     robots and their human masters. Play as Tux in a quest to save the 
     world from the murderous rebel bots who know no mercy. You get to 
     choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is 
     everywhere in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
     FreedroidRPG features a real time combat system with melee and 
     ranged weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo. 
     There is an innovative system of programs that can be run in order 
     to take control of enemy robots, alter their behavior, or improve one's
     characteristics. You can use over 50 different kinds of items and 
     fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. An advanced 
     dialog system provides story background and immersive role 
     playing situations.
    </p>
    <p>
     The game is complete, fully playable, and can provide about 
     12 hours of fun. It is still being actively developed, and 
     help is welcome in many areas. People having - or trying to acquire - 
     programming, map editing, or writing skills will find FreedroidRPG 
     to be an exciting, fast-moving project in which they can fully 
     express their creativity.
