FreedroidRPG Installation 
=========================

To build FreedroidRPG from source on a Unix-like system, you will use the "standard" GNU autotools way.

Dependencies
============

FreedroidRPG requires the following libraries, along with, on the Linux distributions that split them, their associated -dev package.
Make sure you install them before attempting to build.

SDL
SDL_image
SDL_gfx
SDL_mixer (optional)
libogg (optional)
libvorbis (optional)
OpenGL (optional)
lua (optional, packaged in the source tree if not available system-wide)

The packages to install are listed below, depending on your distribution.

1) Debian/Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libogg-dev liblua5.2-dev libjpeg-dev

2) Fedora

yum install SDL_image-devel SDL_net-devel SDL_mixer-devel SDL_gfx-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel libvorbis-devel libGLU-devel 

3) Archlinux

pacman -S libgl libvorbis lua sdl sdl_gfx sdl_image sdl_mixer

There is also a freedroidrpg-git pkgbuild at the arch user repository: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57483

4) Please contribute lists for your distribution!

Building with autotools
=========================

1) Open a terminal. 
   a) Via right click in some file browsers.
   
   b) Via main menu (usually "System" entry).
      Move to the FreedroidRPG source directory using "cd ./XYZ/" command. XYZ = path to the FreedroidRPG source.
   
2) If you are running an git version of the game, you will first need to generate the 
   configure script by running:
   ./autogen.sh
   If you don't know what the git version is, you are not running it and can skip this step.

3) Run the configure script: 
   ./configure
   You can check the options it accepts with --help.
   If you are running MAC OSX you will probably want to use ./configure --with-apple-opengl-framework
   During the configure process, the terminal may notify you that some software is required.
   Install the required packages and restart ./configure.

4) If ./configure finishes without errors or warnings, then proceed with building the game with:
   make

5) Installation
   a) "make install" will install the game system-wide. You need to be root for this. The binary name is freedroidRPG.

      Hint: you can speed up "make" process using "make -j n". Replace "n" with number of jobs.
      For more information execute "make --help".

   b) If you are working with the source tree and want to git pull regularly we 
      recommend the following instead: 
      Do not issue "make install", instead, simply go to the src/ subdirectory, and run
      ./freedroidRPG.



Cross compile for Windows with autotools
========================================

Provided you have a cross compiler installed and set up (see
below for more details), use the following configure line:

$ ./configure  --prefix=/path/to/the/cross/compiler --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --without-x --enable-nls LIBS="-lintl"

One critical point is to make sure you have all required libraries installed. 
You will need to have libogg and libvorbis for sound and music, and will need libintl and its dependencies
to provide translation support.

The binary we ship supports all those features and is built with autotools.
In special cases we may agree to sending you the complete cross-compiler archive so you can build win32 binaries
easily.

Building In Windows
===================

1) Installation of Python

	Python will be needed during the build of FreedroidRPG, so you frist need to install it.
	  Download and install ActivePython from http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads

2) Installation of MinGW

	Before trying to build FreedroidRPG under Windows, you need to setup a development environment that will "mimic" a Unix development environment:
	 Get the lastest version of MinGW from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/
	 Run the downloaded installer, and:
	  * Choose to 'download latest repository catalogues'
	  * Choose following destination: C:\MinGW (if you choose an other destination, you'll have to adapt the rest of this How-To)
	  * On the components selection screen, add 'MinGW Developer Toolkit'

	Once installed, you'll have a new MinGW entry in your Start Menu, and a MinGW Shell subentry.
	 Launch MinGW Shell, and in the terminal window just opened, type:
	  mingw-get install msys-wget
	  mingw-get install msys-unzip
	  mingw-get install msys-mintty

	 If you want a better terminal than the one provided by default, open the properties of the MinGW Shell menu subentry (by right-clicking on it), and change the target to
	 C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat --mintty
	 and launch a new MinGW Shell.

	Nota: When you start a MinGW Shell, the current directory is your HOME directory. This HOME directory can be found in
	C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\<your_username>

3) Git installation

	To retrieve FreedroidRPG source files, you will need to use Git (http://git-scm.com/).
	There are a few graphical git clients for Windows.

	You download GitEye from here http://www.collab.net/downloads/giteye
	Warning, apparently the version is a 30-days-trial warning only. Todo: need to check what happens after these 30 days.

	Once GitEye is running, click "Clone Repository" then "URI" and enter git://git.code.sf.net/p/freedroid/code into the "URI" field.
	You can clone all branches (hit "Next"), for the Directory, you may want to set "freedroidRPG" instead of "code".
	Hit "Finish" to start cloning, progress can be observed in the lower right corner.
	When cloning is finished, you can access the cloned repository in the left column.


4) FreedroidRPG dependencies installation

	In order to compile FreedroidRPG, you have to first install some library dependencies. We provide those libraries in 2 binary packages, so you do not need to compile them yourself
	In a MinGW Shell, type the following commands:
		wget http://buildbot.freedroid.org/downloads/freedroidRPG_dev.tar.gz
		wget http://buildbot.freedroid.org/downloads/freedroidRPG_dependencies.zip
		cd /
		tar -xzf ~/freedroidRPG_dev.tar.gz
		cd /bin
		unzip ~/freedroidRPG_dependencies.zip
		cd /c/WINDOWS/system32
		unzip ~/freedroidRPG_dependencies.zip
		cd

5) FreedroidRPG compilation

	So, you are now finally ready to download and compile the game!

	In a MinGW Shell, do the following:

	 enter freedroid source directory:
	 cd git/freedroid

	 compile the game:
	 ./autogen.sh
	 CFLAGS=-I/include ./configure --without-x --disable-sdltest
	 make


	Nota:, if an error window opens complaining about libgmp-10.dll missing, then you used a bugged version of the MinGW installer
	(some DLLs are not correctly installed). To fix the problem, just type the following commands:
	 cp /mingw/bin/libgmp-10.dll /mingw/libexec/gcc/mingw32/4.5.2
	 cp /mingw/bin/libmpc-2.dll /mingw/libexec/gcc/mingw32/4.5.2
	 cp /mingw/bin/libmpfr-1.dll /mingw/libexec/gcc/mingw32/4.5.2
	 cp /mingw/bin/libiconv-2.dll /mingw/mingw32/bin
	 cp /mingw/bin/libintl-8.dll /mingw/mingw32/bin

	If everything went alright, you will find a freedroidRPG.exe file in the src/ subdirectory. You can launch it from the terminal:
		cd src
		./freedroidRPG

	or you can just double-click on the executable's icon from the File Explorer. You will find it in
	 C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\<your_username>\freedroid\src


Enjoy the game!
