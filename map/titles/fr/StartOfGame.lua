Quelle belle journée.
Yes, I'm being sarcastic again.
La planète entière est en feu.
Des milliers de personnes sont très mortes.
Qwerty and Arensito are not responding.

Ah, yes, I almost forgot.
The bloody bots are about to find me, too.
Ça ne me rend pas vraiment heureux. Pas heureux du tout
I guess I have to pretend I'm just a nice rock, yet again.
Don't you think it would be a great time to wake up?
Get up. Get here. Save my ass.
S'il vous plait.
